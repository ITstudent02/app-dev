# My Favorite Series: **ML**
## About the MOvie 
*ML*is a 2018 Philippine independent psychological horror film written, co-produced, and directed by *Benedict Mique Jr.*, starring *Eddie Garcia* as a retired METROCOM Colonel suffering from Alzheimer's disease, leading him to believe that he is still living in the days of Ferdinand Marcos' dictatorship. He mistakes a visiting student, played by *Tony Labrusca*, as a dissident resisting Martial Law, and captures and tortures him, just as he did back in the 1970s.
### Characters
- **Colonel** (played by *Eddie Garcia*)
-  **Carlo** (played by *Tony Labrusca*)

  ## Why I Love This Series
  1. **Charismatic antagonist** I relly like the performance of *Eddie Garcia*. Eventhough he play as a antagonist in the movie I got nothing but to love the character.
  2. **THe Suspense** in my opinion this is the only Filipino film I watch  where it makes me feel Im on edge of my seat.
